      <p>Hey! I'm Marco. I'm a 12 year old avaiation enthusiast, and a unorthodox, but avid programmer. My areas of interest are math, chemistry, biology, music, and history outside of com sci. I play alto and tenor sax, and have recently began learning guitar. My latest project in com sci was to make a website adventure hame in HTML5, which you can check out on my github, for a sneak peak at the code, or you could use this <a href="https://codereach-anish.github.io/adventuregameANISH/">link</a> to play it right now!

          <h4>Vincent Massey Secondary School Computer Science Club</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p>Hello, and welcome to Computer Science Club (CSC)! Our purpose here is to prepare you for computer science (CS) competitions. This year, CSC is led by Adam Mehdi and Henning Jiang. CSC runs from 3:15 - 5:00 PM every week, unless otherwise stated. We will post club material as we see fit on this group page.

Adam will lead the junior section section of CSC, and will teach in Rm 149 every week, while the senior section will be led by Henning in Rm 148. It is highly recommended that you bring your own computer.

The junior section will be primarily focused on the computer language Python, as well as basic algorithms. The senior section will be covering C++ and a much deeper set of problems in computer science.

Remember, CSC is around to prepare its attendees for CS contests. We primarily focus upon the Windsor’s annual Secondary School Programming Competition (SSPC), held at the university of Windsor during November, the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) in February, and the Educational Computing Organization of Ontario Computing Contest (ECOO-CS) during April.

We will select six people from each section for the SSPC using our own qualifying round, as well as two teams of four total for ECOO-CS. There will be no restrictions on CCC participation.

We wish you all the best of luck!</p>

        <div class="descrition">
          <p>In an ever growing technology-driven world, we strive to prepare young minds in our community for what the future holds. Programming is a sought-after skill that, unfortunately, is not taught in elementary school. We hope that through programming, our students will be proactive when using computers and hopefully reach a point where they can make whatever they want. You can find out more on their website, <a href="https://codereach.ca/.">https://codereach.ca/.</a></p>

          <h4>EdX: CS50's Intro to Computer Science</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p>This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, is Harvard's largest course.</p>
